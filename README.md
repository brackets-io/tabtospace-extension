Brackets Tab to space
=================

A brackets extension to convert tabs to spaces and vice versa.

To install, place the ```tabtospace``` folder inside the ```brackets/src/extensions/user``` folder.


Notes
=====

To use, simply open a project in Brackets, and select ```Convert tabs to spaces``` or ```Convert spaces to tabs``` from the ```File``` menu.

This will replace tabs with four spaces, and replace each four spaces with a tab.

Warning: This version not only converts indentation, but any character, whatever its position in your line, even if it's positioned inside quotes.
